# Welcome to the code gym


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/williscool/code_gym.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/williscool/code_gym)

## The Philosophy

The code gym is like a real life gym. But its code.

Duh right? Well the metaphor is that maybe in training you aren't doing the things you would do on the field but you are training your body to be able to do them at a high level when you get ready.

The code gym is a gym for your mind.

Maybe you don't write code that requires understanding data structures and algorithms or puzzle solving every day... but you do want your code to run efficiently every day.

Here in the code gym we work on things that make us better at what we do.

Working with these kinds of problems and subjects improves our thinking.

## Where is the Good Stuff?

Right now the most interesting stuff is in the javascript section

I have written, tested, documented, and linted several hundred data structures, algorithms, and coding problems in javascript.

Check out the [Javascript README](javascript/js_README.md) for more details.

I am also actively working on porting all of the code to es6 and linting courtesy of airbnb's excellent javascript style guide and eslint plugins as well as babel plugins.

I'm throughly documenting everything as I go as well.

## How its structured

Just like there are different racks and weights in a gym there are different ways to train in the code gym.

The gym is organized by language and subject.

For instance `javascript/data_structures`

Is data structures in js and

`ruby/toj`

is timus online judge solutions [http://acm.timus.ru/?locale=en](http://acm.timus.ru/?locale=en) in ruby.
