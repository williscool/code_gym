 * The Naive version of Dijkstra's algo
 *
 * lightly influenced by
 * https://github.com/gabormakrai/dijkstra-performance/blob/master/Dijkstra.md
 *
 * "Dijkstra's original algorithm does not use a min-priority queue and runs in time O(V^2)"
 *
 * That statement on the wikipedia article is actually technically false.
 *
 * The operation done on line 15 in the pseudocode http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Pseudocode
 *
 * "u ‚Üê vertex in Q with min dist[u]"
 *
 * is actually the same operation as a priority queue but it is a naive and unoptimized one
 *
 * being that it is always going to look for the shortest distance in the queue
 * but in doing so needs to scan all elements each time
 *
 * also hindsight 20/20 this is also just a naive index priority queue.
 * so I could add a set that keeps track what nodes are still left to visit to the naive pq is and use the same interface as the other heaps
 *
 * but ill leave it for the nostalgia of writing a naive pq djikstra from scratch because it took me so long to figure that out lol
 *
 * sidebar I really hate that so many people try to jump to teaching/ writing the most efficient version of an algorithm or data structure
 *
 * it robs the learner of the opportunity to learn the insights that lead the the optimal versions... but I digress

 * Time Complexity: |V^2|
